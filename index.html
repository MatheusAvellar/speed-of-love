          In the song, Wang Chung promises to drive one million miles until

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night">Wikipedia page on "Night"

          singing at one second past <data>4 am</data>, that would give them
          <data>24 hours</data> to drive said thousand miles, requiring a speed
          of at least <mark>67,056 km/h</mark>, which is roughly twice the

          Sadly, although travelling at the same speed, the Wang Chung mustn't
          get the same praise as Gedge, seeing as the latter promises to

          To estimate a speed for Orbison in this song, we must first estabilish
          <em>where</em> he was "driving all night". The song
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Drove_All_Night">"I Drove All
          Night"</a> was written and composed by

          Steinberg</a> and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kelly_(musician)">Tom
          Kelly</a>. According to their Wikipedia pages, they both seem to have
          lived most of their lives in California, USA. According to the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limits_in_the_United_States">
          Wikipedia article on "Speed limits in the US"</a>, the speed limit on
          an urban freeway in California is between <data>80–105 km/h.</data>
          Assuming Orbison was very eager to reach his destination, we can place
          his top speed at about <mark>105 km/h</mark>.

          Here, Gaye and Terrel promise that they will travel <q>as fast as [they]

          Owens doesn't specify any time duration in the song, but we can assume
          that, considering he went Christmas shopping, he must've walked while
          stores were open. According to the <cite>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_hours">Wikipedia page
          on "Shopping hours"</a></cite>, <q>typical store shopping hours</q> in
          the US (Owen's home country) are <q>Monday - Saturday (<data>9:00
          </data> to <data>22:00</data>)</q>. If we consider Owens started his
          walk at <data>9 am</data> and ended it at <data>10 pm</data>, that
          gives him a total of <data>13 hours</data> to walk his alleged <data>
          100 miles</data> <data>(160.9344 km)</data>. That puts his speed at
          around <mark>12.3796 km/h</mark>, or at about half the speed of an

          Although Owens technically isn't singing about meeting a loved one, he
          is singing <em>to</em> a loved one about his beloved children, so this

          However, there is no set speed defined, and thus they might take an
          eternity to accomplish this feat. Moreover, their motivation isn't
          to <em>see</em> a loved one; instead, to their partner they only
          promise thoughts and an urge to call:

          We can trace a path from the southernmost part of South America,
          passing through North America, then over to Asia, southbound to
          Oceania, then heading northwest to Europe, then finally going south to
          Africa. This way, one could cover most continents (the <q>whole wide
          world</q>) and find a loved one. The total distance traveled following
          this path, using a very conservative estimate, would be between <data>
          50,000</data> and <data>70,000 km</data>.

          However, as great hitchhiking as this sounds, Eric doesn't specify at
          what speed he will be travelling at, thus invalidating the entire
          promise.

          In this song, Carpenter promises to, presumably, walk an astonishing
          10 thousand miles (which translates to <data>16,093.44 km</data>,
          close to Earth's diameter, <data>12,742 km).</data> However, she does
          not define a time limit to cover that distance and, therefore, might
          take a lifetime to deliver on the promise.

          Like Mary Chapin Carpenter, in this song Kerr promises to walk a
          whopping 10 thousand miles (about the distance from New York to Sydney,
          <data>9,945 km).</data> But since there is no set timeframe, we cannot
          confidently estabilish a speed for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kerr does at one point say <q>Every single night and day…</q>, hinting
          that it took her multiple days walking. Sadly, that is just not enough
          information to pin down her velocity.

          The Proclaimers here claim that they would walk <data>500 miles</data>
          <data>(804.672 km)</data>, and then another <data>500 miles</data> –
          possibly with a break in between. However, since there isn't a
          timeframe specified, this could potentially take a lifetime to be
          executed, rendering the promise virtually meaningless.
